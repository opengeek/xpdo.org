We have launched a new website for xPDO.org using [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/), xPDO and a few free libraries available via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). It was way overdue and served as a great opportunity to show off xPDO in a context other than [MODX](http://modx.com/). The repository for this site is public and [available at GitHub](https://github.com/opengeek/xpdo.org) if you want to see how it has been developed.


### An Opportunity to Show Off xPDO

Neglected for many years, this site and its desperate need for a makeover seemed a perfect opportunity to show how easy it is to use xPDO in a project. For this I used the latest stable Slim Framework release (2.6.2 as of writing) and the readily available SQLite3 database engine. I just needed a list of xPDO releases to render on the site and keep track of the number of downloads. After a few minutes planning my attack, I dove in and created a [schema for my releases]().
